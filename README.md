# Titanic_Survival_Exploration
This repository contains project files for ‘Project 0 - Titanic Survival Exploration’ as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. 

In this project, I create decision functions that attempt to predict the survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster. Passenger features such as sex and age are used in the prediction model. The survival of passengers is predicted with an accuracy of over 80%.
